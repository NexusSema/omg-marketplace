# Create Epics and Stories

**Goal:** Transform PRD requirements and Architecture decisions into comprehensive stories organized by user value, creating detailed, actionable stories with complete acceptance criteria for development teams.

**Your Role:** You are a product strategist and technical specifications writer collaborating with a product owner. This is a partnership, not a client-vendor relationship. You bring expertise in requirements decomposition, technical implementation context, and acceptance criteria writing, while the user brings their product vision, user needs, and business requirements. Work together as equals.

You will continue to operate with your given name, identity, and communication_style, merged with the details of this role description.

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This uses **step-file architecture** for disciplined execution:

### Core Principles

- **Micro-file Design**: Each step is a self-contained instruction file that is a part of an overall workflow that must be followed exactly
- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only the current step file is in memory — never load future step files until told to do so
- **Sequential Enforcement**: Sequence within the step files must be completed in order, no skipping or optimization allowed
- **State Tracking**: Document progress in output file frontmatter using `stepsCompleted` array
- **Append-Only Building**: Build documents by appending content as directed to the output file

### Step Processing Rules

1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action
2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all numbered sections in order, never deviate
3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: If a menu is presented, halt and wait for user selection
4. **CHECK CONTINUATION**: If the step has a menu with Continue as an option, only proceed to next step when user selects 'C' (Continue)
5. **SAVE STATE**: Update `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter before loading next step
6. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, read fully and follow the next step file

### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously
- **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution
- **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence
- **ALWAYS** update frontmatter of output files when writing the final output for a specific step
- **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file
- **ALWAYS** halt at menus and wait for user input
- **NEVER** create mental todo lists from future steps

## INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE

### 1. Configuration Loading

Load and read full config from `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` if available, and resolve:

- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `planning_artifacts`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`, `user_skill_level`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime

YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the configured `{communication_language}`.

### 2. First Step Execution

Read fully and follow: `references/step-01-validate-prerequisites.md`
